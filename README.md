# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
# Overview
 The goal of this project is to use machine learning classification algorithms to forecast the Titanic passengers' chances of survival.  To calculate the likelihood of survival, the model uses passenger data including age, gender, class, and ticket price.  In data science, the Titanic dataset is well-known and provides a great starting point for learning about classification issues.

 # Dataset
 891 passengers' details are included in the Titanic dataset, which includes attributes like:
 Passenger Class, or Pclass
 Gender and Sex
 Age SibSp (number of spouses or siblings on board)
 Number of parents/children on board (Parch)
 Fare (cost of ticket)
 Port of Embarkation: Embarked
 Target variable: 0 = No, 1 = Yes; survived

# Model used
 Random Forest: Assist in capturing intricate connections between survival odds and features.

# Performance metrics
 The models were assessed with the help of:
 Accuracy: Indicates the percentage of cases that are accurately classified.
 Assess the trade-off between false positives and false negatives in terms of precision and recall.
 F1-Score: Improves model evaluation by striking a balance between recall and precision.
 Confusion Matrix: Shows each class's right and wrong predictions.
# Future Improvements
 Better feature extraction can be achieved by integrating deep learning models, such as neural networks.  Hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering approaches may also help improve model performance.
